#note that we can't use class methods and class variables in making taskservice becoz 
''' 1. of their global nature-- we thought we will create only one instance but in reality multiple instances will be created
        But:
                tests will
                refactoring will
                future code will
                frameworks will
    2. Unit tests will fail like::::

    def test_add_task():
        service = TaskService()
        service.add_task("A")

    def test_empty():
        service = TaskService()
        assert service.list_tasks() == []

    3. With class variables:
        You must now ask:

        Who modified it?

        From where?

        When?

        In what order?

        This breaks local reasoning, which is critical for LLD.

    4. It breaks dependency injection (future FastAPI)

        Later you’ll do:

        def get_service():
            return TaskService()


        FastAPI expects:

        each request → its own service instance

        isolation

        stateless behavior

        Class variables break this completely.

Day 4
Note: when we do self.repo=TaskRepository(), and TaskRepository has filename, we have given the access of the filename(json)
to the TaskService. But this is against abstraction. So we are now going to design interface in TaskRepository
